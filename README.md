# nand2tetris

This is my work on the Nand2Tetris project. See www.nand2tetris.org for details on the project.

This project is for personal use and for educational purposes only. The goal is to start out with a basic NAND logic gate and build an entire computing system (CPU, ALU, and Memory).

On the software side of things, a Virtual Machine translator is implemented in java (projects/07 and projects/08), a compiler is developed (projects/10 and projects/11). The translator and compiler are developed in Java.
